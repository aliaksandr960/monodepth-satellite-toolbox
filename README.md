# Monodepth Satallite Toolbox
*Functionality to process satallite imagery with Monocular Depth neural networks*

# Usage:
- *python pipeline.py 'path to reconstruction folder'*, reconstruction folder should have *'raster.tif'* file
- use jupyter-notebook and *pipeline.ipynb* file

Both files have dictionary with configuration, so you could adjust it.

Best use with Z18 scale, or about 0.6m GSD.

## This toolbox can:
1. **Split big GeoTIF image on patches, process each patch with monocular depth model, normalizer results and save as GeoTIF image**

2. **Segment wall and —Åliffs**

3. **Ortho from perspective images**

4. **Occlusion map, to see what cannot be seen**

## Algorithms description:

#### 1. split.py

- Grabs GeoTiff, split it to overlapping patches.

#### 2. depthmaps.py

- Perform monocular depth estimation for each patch using **Apple DepthPro** or **Meta Depth Anything** models **(configurable)**.

- Rellys on **HuggingFace** Transformers module, so it could be easy to integrate any model avaliable on **HuggingFace**.

#### 3. heightmaps.py

- Invert depthmaps

- Do min-pooling and smoothing to estimate background bias

- Substract background from inverted depth

*Could be a probles on really large buildings*

#### 4. directions.py

- Slice inverted depth with high gradients by some number of levels

- Skeletonize and cross-correlate levels between each other

- Max cross correlation is view direction

![Cross correlation](docs/cross_corr.jpg)

#### 5. basic_analytics.py

- After having view direction, it is possible to estimate subvertical surfaces and normalize inverted depth maps

- Calculate walls and cliffs


#### 6. merge_analytics
- Overlapping patches merging using center-distance weighting to minimize visible differences between them
